# Project Resume

This assignment was a great way to learn how to convert a static site into a responsive site. Responsive sites are the current trend and are basically expected in the web design industry today, so it is a great skill to know.

## Custom jQuery Code Explanation

This custom code can be found in the Interests section of my resume. When the mouse enters the area of the icon image, the image will expand and become slightly transparent. When the mouse leaves the area of the icon image, the image will shrink back to around its original size and it won't be transparent anymore.

## Resources

* [jQuery API Documentation](http://api.jquery.com/) was used to better understand event handlers and to know what options are available for certain events.

* [CSS3 Generator](http://api.jquery.com/) was used to help style different elements of the project.

* [Animate Scroll](http://plugins.compzets.com/animatescroll/) was used to implement one of the required jQuery plugins. This plugin was implemented into the navigation of the site. When a user clicks on one of the navigation links, it will scroll down to that section with an animated scroll.

* [scrollUp](https://markgoodyear.com/2013/01/scrollup-jquery-plugin/) was used to implement the second required jQuery plugin. This plugin was implemented into the whole body itself. When a user scrolls below a certain pixel height, a small tab in the bottom right corner of screen will pop up. When the tab is clicked, it takes the user back to the top of the page.

* [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) was used to better understand jQuery events and pseudo elements.

* [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/) was used to help create a triangle shape with css.

* [HTML5 Boiler Plate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169) was used to help style out some of the HTML structure elements with the "visuallyhidden" class to keep the design clean.

* Other than what is listed above, I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### Comments

It was awesome having the opportunity to create an online version of our resumes. It was also great to see how everything we've learned this semester has built on top of each other, which I'm sure we will notice even more with our final projects. My favorite part of this project was finally getting my first jQuery plugin to work because from there I was able to implement the second plugin with ease and write my own custom jQuery code I never would've thought I could do had I not had that base to start from. Loved this project!
